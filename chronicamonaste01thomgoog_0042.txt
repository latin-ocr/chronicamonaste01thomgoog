It refers almost exclusively to Edward the Third’s
French wars, and is taken from a source independent of
the common authorities. Ocmmencing with the irruption
of Edward into Frcncb territory from Antwerp in the
autumn of 1339, it recorda the incident of alarm raised
in the Frenoh army by the ehouting of English soldiers
alter a hare, and the creation of knights by the Frenoh
king, Philip, in expectation of an immediate engagement;
adding that they were ever after called knights of the
hare. Froissart gives the anecdote, but in different
terme, and without some of the particulare mentioned by
our chronicler.

In the account of the great noval battle off Sluya, in
the year 1340, he represents that Edward brokc the array
of the French ships, which he found chained together,
by seigning ssight and drawing them after him in pursuit.
He adds the anecdota that a witty saying got about, in
reference to the green slaughter of the French, that if
God had given speech to the fishes of the sea, they

would aesuredly have ever alter talked in French, from
the numbers of Frenchmen they had feasted on. Hc
concludes his reference to thia event with the statement,
that Edward III. struck a new coinage of a gold
noble in commemorationes his naval victory, aud de-
scribes its type as a ship, with the legend “ J esus autem
“ transiens per medium eorum ibat.'' He thus supplies
an explanation of the origin of this coin,-a type fol-
lowed in many succeeding reigna-given by no other
early historian. Ruding‚ indeed, bae surmised the truc
occasion of the coinage, but without producing any
authority in support os his explanation. Earlier writers,
including Oamden, Selden and chge,¹ had been more or
or leae at fault in their conjectures
