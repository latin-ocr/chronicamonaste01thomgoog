ΟΝ the 26111 01 J anuary 1857, 1110 Masler of the Itolls

, submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication

01 materials for the History of tbis Oountry from 1110
Invasion of the Romans to the Beign of Henry VIII.

The Master 01 thaRolls suggested that these 'materiale
should be selected for publication under competent

, editors without reference to periodical or chronological

arrangement, without mutilation¹ or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most scarae and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historieal docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an EdItio Princeps3 and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate cellatica 01 the best MSS.

To render the work more generally uselul, the Master
01 the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account 011110 MSS. employed by him, 01 their age and
their peculiarities; that he should add to the work a
briei account oi the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology; but no
other note or comment was to be allowed, except what

might be necessary to establish the correctness 01 the
text.
