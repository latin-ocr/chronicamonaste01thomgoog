appropriation. Fortunately the king, atter inspection
of all the documenta connected with the case, confirmed

The course of proceeding in effecting the appropriation
of the ohurch of Keyingham was exactly similar to thet
followed in the case of moringam only that, from want
of meane to purchase his immediate resignation, tho
minister appointed to hold the living, on the resignation
of Hugh de narville, retained possession oi it lor about
five years aiter the appropriation had been granted by
the amhbishop of York. The monks in this instance
also were obliged to have reoourse to Sir Robert Hilton
fora loen oi 180 marks, and obtained it by the similar
engagement of maintaining a chentry for his family in
Fowlstone.1

prospective permanent advantages by temporary sacri·
lices, ie illustrated by these maneactions. The living
of Eesington, which it cost the convent so much to
become possessed of, they letto farm for the small rent

of 20 marks.
During abbot Hugh’s government, the convent was

little troubled by lawsuits. They had some difficulty
in pmteoting themselves from an unjust exaction of
the subsidy of a ninth granted aethe king in the
llth year of his reign3 and they were unsucoessful in

disputing with the canons ol Watton a claim of duee
to their mill in Skymc.
