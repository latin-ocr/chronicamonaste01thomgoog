This work has long beenjnstly celebrated, but not thoroughly understood until
Mn. Stubbs’ edition. The earlier portion, extending from 732 ιο 1148, appears
ιο be a copy ot'e compilation made in Northumbn'n about iioi, to which
Hoveden added little. From 1148 ιο 1169-ο very valuable portion ol this
work-the metieris derived from another source, to which Hoveden appears ιο
hove supplied little, and not always judicionsly.

From 1170 to llinj is the portion oi the work which corresponds with the ,
Ghroniele known under the name of Benedici of Peterborough (see No. te); l
but it ie not e copy, being sometimes an abridgment, at others apemphrase oi l

access to the same materiale, but deelt with them differently. From rina to
1201 nruy be snid to be wholly Hoveden's wonky it ie extremely rnluable, and
an authority of the first importanoe.
