There is, in this volume, a legendary account of the peopling 01 Ireland and 01
110 adventures which befell the 11110111 heroes who ere said to hare been con-
nected with Irish history. The details are, however, wery meagrc both 101 thia

Itis probable that Pierre de Langtoft was a canon 01 Bridlington, in Yorkshire,
and 111110 lived in 110 reign 01 Edward1.,and during a portion 01 the reign 01
Edward 11. This chronicle is dirided into three parts; in the first is an
abridgment 01 Geoffrey 01 Moumouth's “Historia Britonum,” in the second,a
history of 1101111 lo·Saxon and Normau kings, down to the death 01 Henry 111,
und in the third a ’ tory 01 the reign 01 Edward 1. The principal object of the
work was apparently to show the justice 01 Edward’s Scottish wara.

The language iu which the chronicle is written is singularly corrupt, and isa
curione specimen 01 the French onorkshire.
