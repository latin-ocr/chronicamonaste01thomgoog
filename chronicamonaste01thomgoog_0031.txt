attributes the final settlement of the case to assistance
from the latter. It may be inferred from these admissione
that the general sympathy was with theman who were
struggling to hee themselves from serfdom-a condition
revolting to an advaneing sense of justice and liberty,-

and that bribery was freely used by the abbot in sup·
