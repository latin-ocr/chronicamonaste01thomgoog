the number 01 fifty-cne3 and he further states that the
prudent abbot Michael left at his death, in the year
1249, as many as sixty monks and ninety lay brothton.
It ean herdly be considered that, in proportion 10 the
large accumulatior 01 means which hed been effected
during the first century 01 the establishment 01 the mo·
ncstmy, this increase 01 the numbers mainteined in it
was large, or that it indicates 0 degree 01 earneetness
corresponding 10 the zeal shown during the first years 01
foundation Yet, instead 01 inoreasing, the number
subsequently declined. In the year 01 the great pesti-
10000,Α.1).1319, the abbot and monks numbered only
forty-two, and the conversi seven. And still later, in
the year 139010 the list 01 the convent inserted by
Burtcn in his collection of accounts and documents
relating 10 the monastery, the number 01 monks is
given as only twentyeight including tho abbot. It
must bo charitably presumed 11101 this falling off was
partly occasioned by the great lossos sustained in the
destruction 01 the abbey lande by inundatione, and by
the embarrassments consequent 00 the mismenagement
01 the affairs 01 the house recorded in the present
volume3 hut the extent 01 what we shall show was 1110
clear income 01 the house at this period ought 10 have
sufficed for the maintenanee 01 a much larger family
01 1001 ascetics

Then we ask ourselves, what was the position and maneret
character 01 the persons who were received into the ΡΡοΡῗΡΡθὲΡξὸ
monastery as members 01 the convent. From the namesrn ‹mnkr
01 such as are mentioned they appear 10 have been
principally natives 01 the neighbourhocd; and, like
Burton himself, they were probably devoted 10 the cleis-
ter iiam their early youth. But, 110111 incidental notices
01 particular cases 01 admissions 10 the house, it would
seem 11101 they were not unfrequently persons 01 adven-
ced ege, who had passed their lives in the active affairs
01 the world, und were content 10 die within 1110 walls
01 the monastery in undisturbed peace. 101110 a·
