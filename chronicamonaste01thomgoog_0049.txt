the meintenonce ol one monle, himself died e norico in
the house “ in hebitu regrrlcri.''1 And Thomas, eon of Sir
John of Meeux of Owthorne, ester having married end
roered e lorge family, falling into poor circumstances et
Beverley, gave to the monastery the property he hed
received with hie wife, end entered ce e novicel He did
this during his wifc's lifetime‚ end geve ewcy her lende
without her consent. she recloimed the property, end
the monks hed to pey twenty merke lor her con-
firmation of her husbend’s donation. In this letter
instance, it ie evident thot edmiseion to the convent was
purchased ae c meene of meintenonce for life3 end thie
was probably the ordinary inducement for enlering
it, when the period of zeelous ascetioiem herl possed

ness ci the world seems to heve been the preveiling
motive for secking the cloister.

A third end equally interesting matter of considere· noce of
tion in respect to the monks themselves,is to what extent ffigffsfhe
their livee were regulated by the striet principles of mor-
tification, seclusion end renunciation of worldly intc-
rests, which they professed. Whetever moy heve been
their individue] charactere, e little reflection on the con-
stitution of the convent will melre it clear thet conformity
with ite more necetic regulntione was improcticeble with
e considerable number of them. The character cf the
present chronicle, end equelly of other recorde of reli-
gious homes, impresees the reeder with the strong convic-
tinnibat, despite thenominolly severe rontineof monastic
life, the temporel affairs of the house were the principel
matter of concern with the majority of the inmetes.
