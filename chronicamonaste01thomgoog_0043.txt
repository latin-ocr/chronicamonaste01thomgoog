PREFACE. xxxiii

Under the year 1342, in speaking of the danger in-
curred by king Edward, in crossing from Franco, our obro- '
nioler ascribes the violence of the storm to the agency of
evil spirits under the spell of four masters iu necro-
mancy, urged to the exercise of their art by tho queen
of Franee. He stigmatises this lady‚—Jeanne of Bur·
grmdy,-as a J ezebel, a monster of vindictiveness3 and
rejoioes that she was punished by bringing forth abortire
progeny, the last of whom was born without joints to
either feet or hands, and with eyes rigid as wood.

The invasion of Aquitaina by the earl of Derby in
1345 is related with much greater fulness than in other
English histories3 and Edward's expedition of 1346 aud
the battle of Oressy are narrated with differenoes from
the accounts of other English writers or of Froissart.
Among other variations, our chronicler,states that the
ford across the river Scine, between St. Valery and
Orotoy, was betrayed to Edward by an Englishman, born
in Roeston near N‘afferton,-a place, be it observed‚
where the convent had estates—who bad lived in those
parts for sixteen years.

A chapter is devoted to the invasion of England by
David king of Scotland, and to the battle of Neville's.
Oross3 and then the story of the siege of Calais is cir·
cumstautially related. A notice of the great pestilence
of 1349 concludes the historical portion under Hugh the
fifteenth abbot; and when resumed‚ for the last time,
under the following abbot, only a few events are notieed‚
and those very slightly. It is safe to infer, therefore,
that Burton used an authority for the French wars which
terminated with the capture of Calais, and had no work
at hand to instruct him in particulare of subsequent

incidente.

There is little to draw attention to in the continuation The epu,-

of the history of the house by a later hand, subjoined to ffssfflg
Burtou's chronicle. The prinoipal matter of interest isChronicle.
