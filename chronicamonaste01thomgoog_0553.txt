On 25 July 1822, the Honse of Commone presented an addrese to the
Crown, stating that the editione of the works of our ancient historiens were
inconvenient and defective; that many of their writings still remaincd in
manuscript, and, in some cases, in a single copy only. They added, “ that an
‘⁶ uniform and convenient edition of the whole, published underHie Majeety'e
“ royal sanction, would be an undertaking honourable to His Majeety’e reign,

“ and conducive to the edvancement of historicel and constitutional know·
“ ledge; that the House therefore humbly beeought His Majesty, that He
‘⁸' would be graciously pleased to give such directione as His Majesty‚ in His
“ wisdom, might think fit, for the publicationes acomplete edition of the
“ ancient historiens of thie malm, and assured His Majesty that whatever
“ expense might be necessary for thie purpose would be made good.’'

The Master of the Rolls, being very desireue that effect should be given
to the resolution of the House of Commone, submitted ιο Her Majeety’s
Treasury in 1857 a plan for the publication of the ancient chronicles and
memoriale of the United Kingdom, and it was adopted accordingly. In
eelecting these werke, it was considered right, in the first instance, to
give preference to those of which the manuscripts were unique, or the
materiale of which would help to llll up blanhs in English history for
which no satisfactory and authentic information hitherto exiemd in any
accessible form. One grem object the Master of the Rolls had in view was
ιο fenne corpus turoneum within reasonable limite, and which should be
ae complete as possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was important
that the historical student should be able to select such volumee ee conformcd
with his own peculiar testes and studies, and nothe put to the expense of
purchasing the whole collection; an inconvenience inseparable from any
other plan than that which has beon in thie instance adopted.

Of the Chronicles and Memorials, the following volumes have been pub-
lished. They embraee the period from the earliest time of British history
down ιο the end of the reign of Henry vn.
