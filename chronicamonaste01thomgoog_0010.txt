The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they wore finished ; the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s lheasm'y, after a aareful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a

Trcasury Minuta, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important

national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner, Ι ¹

within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to eoonomy, in making the detailed arrange·
ments, without unneoessary expense.'’

They expressad their approbation of the proposal that
each Chroniole and historioal document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible cor-
rectness the text of each writer, derived from a collation
of the best Mas, and that no notes should be added,
except such as were illustrative of the various readings.
They suggested, however, that the prefaoe to each work
should eontain, in addition to the particulam proposed
hythe Master of the Ralla, a biographioal account of
the author, so far as authentia materiale existed for that
purpose, andan estimato of his historical credibility and
value.

December 1857.
