It remains to add afew remarks on the constitution
and characteres the convent itself, its methods of ac
quiriug property, and other subjects illustrated in the
course of the narrative.

As the direct aim in'the institution of monasterias of
the Oisteroian order was to encourage and enable men
to withdraw themselves from the world, and to live in
habitual practice of sels-mortification, labour, and prayer,

it is natural to inquire to what extent this object was ⁸

and he was not aware ol there ever having been a regu-

the same abbot's period, endowed the monastery with
