Altbough this Chronicle tells of the arrival of Hengist and Herse in England
in the year ⁴49, yet it substantially begins with the reign 01 Κ113 Alfred, and
comes down to the yeer 1292, where it ends abruptly. The history is particu-
larly veluable for notices 01 eventsin the eastern portione os the kingdom,
which are not to be elsewhere obtained, and some curicus 11011 are mentioned

relative to the fioods in that part of Ruglaud, which are 0011111011 11 the Fries-

be called satires, audsome 311010 more thane court scandsl; but as a whole
they presente very feir picture 01 society, and 01 tlte relations of the different

The period comprised 11 11 111011 interesting, end brings us, through the decline
of the feudsl system, to what may be considered the beginning of our medem
