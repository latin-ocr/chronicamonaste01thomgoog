Robertof of Easington or to the convent's manor of Dymelton,

iifflffigand by what title. The inquisition was taken at

1³⁵⁶-1³⁶⁷·Hed0n, in the thirty-second year of Edward the Third
[1358]; and it was declared by the jurors that tha
men were direct descendants, through four generations,
osone Robert Hurt, a bondman, who had been oon-
veyed by Geoffrey Gybwyn to the abbay. The escheator
was thereupon commanded to restore tha men, with
all their goods and “ sequelae,'' or familias, to the abbot.
The goods were given up, but Richard Gellarer was still
at large, and could not be found. Nor did the bond-
men acquiesce in the proceedings. They moved a oom-
plaint before the king, doubtless through Richard Oel-
larer, that the abbot had, on a certain day before the
taking of the inquisition, foroibly taken away plough-
men hired by them, and had deprived them of their
service, in breach of the statute of laboursrs observed in
Yorkshire. The abbot was suddenly attached to answer
to this plaint, by seizure of the horsea on which he and
his attendants were riding to Hedon, in order to de-
liberato with the auditore of the king and princeos
Isahella, then tenant of the lordship of Holderness for
life,l on the subject of these proceedings The horses
were impounded at Brustwiok, and the abbot had to
hire animale to carry him home. The case was opened at
the assizes at Hedon ; but the abbot refused to plead to u
plaint brought against him by his own bondmen. The
complainants were forced to admit their condition, and
were accordingly nonsuited. They immediately appealed‚
however, to the king, through Richard Oellarer, who
was still at large; and the record of the case was
ordered to be transmitted to tho king’s chancery.
Richard Oellarer had sucoeeded in gaining the support

of soma of ths king's counoil, who were no friends tc
