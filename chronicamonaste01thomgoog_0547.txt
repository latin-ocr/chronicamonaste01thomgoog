As far back as the year 1800, 0 Committee ef the House 01 Gemmeus
recommended that Indexes and Calendars should be made to the Public
Records, and thirty-six years afterwards another 0000011100 01 the House of
Commoris relterated that recommendation in mere fercible words; but it '
was not until the incorporation 01 the State Paper Office with the Publio
Record Officc that the present Master ef the Itells found himself in 0 position
to take the necessary steps fer carrying 001 the wishes of the Hense ef
Gemmeus.

On 7 December 1855, he stated to the Lords 01 the Treasury that although
“ the Recorde, State Papers, and Documents in his charge constitute the mest
“ complete and perfect series 01 their kind in the civiliaed world,” aud
although “they are 01 the greatest vnlue in a historicul and constitutional
“ point 01 view, yet they are eomparatively useless to the public, from the
“ want 01 proper Calendars and Indexes.'’

Acting upon the recommendatione of tho Committees of the House of
Gemmeus above referred 10, he suggested te the Lords of the Treasury that
10 effect the object he had iu view it would be necessary for him to employ 0
few persons fully qnalified to perform the work which he contemplated.

Their Lordships assented 10 the necessity 01 having Calendars prepared
and printed, and empowered the Master 01 the Rolls 10 take such steps as
might be necessary fer this purpose.

The following Works have been already published under the directiones
the Master 01 the Rolls :-
