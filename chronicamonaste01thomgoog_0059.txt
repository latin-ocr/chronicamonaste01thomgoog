its hospitality. The pope drew revenue from it, and fed
his numerous court by charges of litigation which his

unjust advantages, as legal redress was their resort for
whatever wrongs they might be subjected to. In depend-

retain permanent counsel. Their connection with other
houses and their relation to the pope, gave them the means
of securing support at the court of Rome. Their local
influence served to win over the favour of magistrates
