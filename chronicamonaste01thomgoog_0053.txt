charge of granges and forms, where they were mostly
employed, and forced them to meniel and mechanical
employments.1 Many, however, lived in tbe monastery ;
for they bad a separate dormitory and infirmory, and
stalle were provided for them on either side of the
western end of the church? aa far as possible removed
from the scats of the monke, in the cheir. Theatra
niele gives them an indifferent character. In addition
to the presumption which gave so much offanae to abbot
Richard of Ottringham, their conduct in'the time of
his successor, abbot Michael‚ was eo annoying to one
ol the landowners in Waghen, as to drive him to dis-
poee of his property.³ Perhaps the difficulty of duly
controlling them moy have led to their number being
reduced ; for, when recounting the ravages of the great
pestilenoe of 1349, the chronicler etatae the numbers in
the conventtohave been forty-three monke and only seven
aevae. Subequently, under the abbacy of William
of Scerborongh (al). leva-1396), we are told that
tbe monastery vae altogether without concerni, and that
their place was supplied by monke.4 Itis possible that,
though suppreesed within the house, they were still
extant as bailiffs and labourers in the granges. In the
rentol of the monastery, of the year 1396, under the
head of tbe lendorp, the officer or former of that de·
periment is stated to be obliged to furnieh boote and
shoee in different quantities to the several inmates
and dependente of the house, including the “ conversi
“ claustrales'’ and the “grangiarii ;'' which latter may

be interpreted as the “ conversi'’ of the granges.⁵ Itis
remarkable, however, that in the liet oi the monks and
the servante ol the monastery, in 'Burton'e ample collec-
tione relating to the property and condition of the house,

the coracerei are nowhere notioed.⁵ The explanationes
