this great reduction and apparent suppression of the class
Ipresume to be, that the landa of the monastery had
become very much to be let out 10 farm, and the services
of 00000001 were 001 called for in that direction; aud
that, for the offices 01 11ιο house itself, it was found more
convenient to employ hired servants than to support a
class of half-monks who had been found not very amen-
ableto discipline. The arrangement was economically
a good one; but it involved a complete sacrifice of oom-
munity 01 labour and religious restraint. If we recognize
itas aprimary objectos the institution of the order to
extend its influenee as widely as possible, and to embrace
in one family, though under different vows, all who oon-
tributed to raise from the scil the produce which main-
tained the general members of 11ιο convent, we cannot
fail to be struck with tbs result displayed in the present
record, that after alapae 01 centesies, when the ravenue
01 the monastery had increased many-feld, one division
of the community-the humbler, but the more numerous
under the original foundation-had been reduced 10 an
insignificant proportior, and, as it would seem, eventually
altogether extinguished; and that the direct benefits of a
most splendid endowment were come to be monopolized
by 0 scanty band 01 monks, not a fifth of the number 01
joint monks and coaceraa' who, 0 few years after the
establishment 01 the house, maintained themselves on
smaller resourcca

the considerationes the means by which they acquired
their large estates. As the number of the monks sus·
tained by the house may be taken as a measure 01 its
acal and devotedness to the highest objeots of its foun-
dation, so the frequency and extent of donatione to it
may be accepted as showing the amount 01 approval and
sympathy it received from the surrounding population 3
and the means employed in making further additions
