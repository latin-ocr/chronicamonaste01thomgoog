own cultivation, sometimes under “ custodes‚” appointed
from their own body,1 sometimes under lay bailius, and
principally leased 10 tenunts. The amount of these
estates in acreage cannot be stated with exaetness.

“ tium‚'’ and in which the total number of acres of each
estate isgiven, distinguishing the plough land from the
pasture. Tho general total amounts to 8955 acres.
But this extent was evidently made a considerable time
before the date at which we are reviewing the property
of the house; for the lande in numerous places are
altogether omitted. What these omissione would amount

to may be calculated from the proportion which the ’

value of the lande included in the extent bears 10 thet
of thone omitted. The total yearly rents, in the year
1394, are stated by Burton 10 have been 338i. 171. The
rents from the lande in the extent amounted to 2371.

higher than this calculation, because lande represented
