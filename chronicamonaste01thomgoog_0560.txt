Τὴι object ol this work is ιο publisb notices oi ull known sources osBritisb
history, both printed and uuprinted, in one continued sequence. The materiale,
when historical (as distinguished from biographical), are “rangeri under the
year in which the latest event is recorded in the chronicis or history. and not
under tbe period in which its author, real or supposed, honrishcd Biographias
are camerated under the year in which the person commemorated died¹ and not
under the year in which tbe life was written. This arrangement has two
advantagcs: tbc materiale for any given period maybe seen at aglancey and
if the reader knows the time when an author wrote, and the number σι’ years
that bad elapsed between the date ot the events andthetime tlte writer flourished
he will generally be enablcd to form afair estimare ol the comparative valae ol
the narrative itsels. A bricianalysis oseach work bas been added when descrring
itin which the original portione arc distinguished from those which are mere
compilatione. When possible, the sources are indicated from which such conr-
pilatrons have been derived A biographical sketch oi the author of each piece
bas been added, and ebriet notice bas also been given of such British authors as
have written on historioal subjecte.
