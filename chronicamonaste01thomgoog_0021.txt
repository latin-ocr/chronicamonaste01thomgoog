1011100. xi

There are few other incidente deserving special Hughos
notioe; but an anecdota of unusual interest 10 1101ξᾶᾝω,
history 01011 is recorded, which comes unexpectedly 1³³⁹·1349·
upon us in 1110 prosaic narrative of the chronicler.
Abbot Hugh desired to have a new crucifix placed
in the choir 01 the convent3 and 11 10 stated that
1110 sculptor employed in sarving it reverentially
worked on tho finer portione 01 the image on Frideys
only, while fasting on bread and watcr3 and that, in
order to guido him in designing the figure and to enable
him to give 0 greater beauty 10 the form, he had a
naked model always before him.

It was 10 001110 purpose 11101 so much reverenoe and
conscientious study was exercised in the execution of the =
work. When the erucifix was completed and erected in
110 place, it was found 10 be endowed with miraculous
powers. The monke were doubtlees benefited by the re·
00101100 11 acquired; and they reflected that, if women
could be allowed aeaeae 10 11, the double advantage would
accrue, that general devotion would be promoted, and
much additional profit secured 10 the monastery. They
therefore procured authority from the abbot of Citeaux
10 allow 000000 10 the crucifix 10 both men and women
of honest character, with the cautious proviso that the
latter were not 10 enter the cloister, 01 dormitory, 01
other offices. The chronioler thinks, however, that the
admission 01 semeles proved 110011 011 evil and a cause of
loss to the monastery3 for many came without any
feeling 01 devotion-that is 10 say, without making any
offering‚-but merely 10 look over the church and put
the convent 10 expense in entertaining them.

It is not 10 he wondered at that abbot Hugh found
himself unable 10 increase 01 embellish the buildings of
the convent. He discontinued the works on the ohapel
over the great entrance which had been commenced by

hie predecessor, abbot Adam, and even removed much
01 the structure already finished.
