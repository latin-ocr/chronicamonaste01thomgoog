As William 61 Dringhow was subsequently reelected, Imm&
his first short tenanoy 61 office is not regarded by the
chronicler ss a distinct abbacy‚ in the numbered series 61
superiora 61 the house.

'l'hc nomination to the abbaey by the abbot 61161111- John

seul, which the convent bound itsell' to maintain in
the ehurch 61 Easington.

It was not to be expected that abbot Ryslay would
