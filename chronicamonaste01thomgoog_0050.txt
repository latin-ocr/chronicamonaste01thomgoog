The tone in which the several abbots are spoken of
shows that those were beldin highest estimation by the
fraternity who evinced most acuteness in eonducting
the secular business of the house. The ordinary manage·
ment of affairs must needs have filled the minds of the
monks with other subjecte than those they were pre-
sumed to be engrossed in. The duties of the various
offices divided among the members of the convent were
of a secular character. In the list of the monks drawn
up by Burton in the year 1393, full half the number are
noted as holding offioes requiring considerable attention
to business. The abbot himselfi-who, it is abundantly

engaged in litigation and other business of more than
ordinary difficulty—the cellarer and sub-cellarer, the
chamberlain, the bursar, the porter, the precentor, and
sacristam, had each under his management the funde
allotted for the support of his own department3 and we
find enumerated a granger of Skyme, a monk of the
bakehouse, a master of the cattle, a bailiff of Slrypsea,
and keepers of the two infirmarias, for the monks and for
laymen. In a great establishment such as that of
Meaux Abbey, these offices would involve laborious
duties.

Tben we know that monks were deputed to serve in
chantries at a distance from the monastery3 and a re-
laxation of the striotness of living resulted from their
freedom from control. An instance will come to mind
in the establishrnent of that at Ottringham, in the time
of Roger the thirteenth abbot, nl). last-1310. It
was to be served by seven monks from the monastery ;
but in less than twenty-five years they had become so
much the subject of scandalous remark that it was found
necessary to remove the chantry to the immediate
neighbourhood of the monastery.

The Oistercian mouks were employed also to overlook
the lay brethren at the granges; audit is probable that
