PREF'ACE. · XXV

A disputa arose with the frceholders of Sutton respect· t·W ssiam
ing the boundsry ditches of the convent 's proper tybf'soc gh
adjacent 11 the common. These had become almost ob· lssthu agbio ot,
literated by time and the cattle from the common made ¹³⁷² ¹³⁹⁶²
havoc among their oropo. Sir Thomas Sutton 111 the
frecholders objected to the ditches being repaired. A
general maeting of the parties was held 111111 convent's
11111. Oharters were examined, the traces oi the trenches
inspected, the ancient use of the freeholders inves-
tigated ; and it was only by the favouring help of Sir
Thomas himself that the right to restore the ditches was
conceded. But the gain to the convent was an additional
mark on the rent of their enolosure.

A more troublesome contest had to be fought with
certain tile -mukers of Beverley, who claimed and for
cibly exercised a right cf helping themselves to soil suit -
able for their purpose, found between the bank and
ohsnncl 11 the Hull along the convent's land at Waghen
aud Sutton. The monks seized the cam 111 tools of the

trespsssers 11 11 purpose. 8ο they impounded their
burge with its frcight3 and this 11111 upon them the
provost of Beverley, already imitated by their refusal
to allow the removal of a stone rectory at Easiugton.
He instigated the 111111 to persist in their claim to the
soil os tenente of the archbishop ol York aud college ol'
Beverley. They seized a monk of Meaux in the streets

os Beverley and put him in prison, and threatened tc
11111 the abbot 111 the rest of the convent in the same
manner. The monk was kept in jail for a considerable
time; but the king being expected to visit Beverley,
111 the men not altogether liking the prospect of their
' acts being submitted to royal investigation, they oon-
sented tc appear at the monastery's court of Waghen,
and made due submissior.
But the most conspicuous and the saddest event under

abbot William’s government was a repetition of inunda-
tione of the convent's lond hordering the Humber at Sal-
