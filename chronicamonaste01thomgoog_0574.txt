This important and unique surrey of the greater portion oi England*is the

oldest and mostvaluablc record in the national archires„ It was commenoed
about thc year 1084 and finishcd in 1086. Its compilation was determined upon
at Gloucestcr hy William the conqueror, in council‚ in order that he might
hnow what was due ιο him, in the way of tax, lhom his subjecta, and that each
at the same time might know what he had to pap. lt was compiled as much
ior their protection ss sortire henefit of the sorerergn. The nobility and penple
had been grievously usnemu at the time by the kin bringing orer large num·
bers ol hhench and Bretons‚ and quartering them nulia subjecta, ‘⁴ esch accord-
“ ing to the measure oi his land‚'' ior the purpose os resisting the invasion oi
cnut, Kiug oi Denmarlr, which was apprehended. 'l'he commissionem appointed
to maire the surrey were to inquire the name oi each place3 who held it in the
time of King Edward the Coniessor3 the present possessor: how many hides
were in the manor3 how many ploughs were in demesne i how many homagersr
how many villeins ; how many cottars3 how many sarving οπεος how many free
tenants; how many tenants in soccuge; how much wood‚ mesdow, and pasturc t
the number oi mills and lish-ponds ς what had been added or taken away from
the placc3 what was the gross waluc in the tirne oi Edward the confessor-3 the
present value ς and how much each free-man or soc-man had, and whether any
advance' could be made in the vulne. Thus could be ascertained who held the
mtatein the time ol King Edwards who then haruin its valne in the time of
the late king3 and its valna ss it stood at the formation oi the surrey. So
minute was the¹ surrey, that the writer of the contemporary portion oi the Sason
Chronlcle records, with some asperity-“So very narrowly he caused it ιο be
“ traced out, that there was not a single hide, nor one wirgate of land, nor even,
‘¹ it is chame to tell, though it scemed to him no shame to do, an ox, nor rr now,
‘⁴ nor oswine was leit, thatwas not set down.”
